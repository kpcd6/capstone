Steps to install github tools

1) Go to: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git
2) Install the Github native app if you want and install the latest version 
of Git. If you're doing everything over babbage, git should already be installed.
3) Follow the Instructions on the Set up Git webpage


Steps to fork the github repository ( in other words, make a copy of it on your machine that you can change and edit without compromising the main working version of the project) 

1) Go to: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo and follow the directions to fork this project
(note:it's a little harder on windows but there are instructions)
2) instead of Spoon-Knife.git the git repository is called capstone so use the command
git clone https://github.com/harrison-n/capstone.git
3) make sure you do the Configure Remotes step 

Make changes to the project and commit them to the repository

1) So now you should have the most updated version of the project and have these files in the folder capstone - "README.md, gettingStarted, names.txt"
2) We are going to add our name to the names.txt file and update the repository. 
3) open up names.txt in your clone of the repository 
4) add [Your name] has completed this exercise
5) save your changes and exit names.txt
6) make a commit and update the repository by running:

	git add names.txt

	git commit -m '[add description of your update here]'

	git push origin master

You should see something like this that tells you everything has been updated: 

harrison@air ~/Documents/Capstone/capstone $  > git push origin master

So now lets say we are all working on the project and I've made changes to the repository and your clone of the repository 
isn't up to date anymore. Running these commands will update your clone.

git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master


That's all for now. If you get stuck please let me know - git has a learning curve if you've never used it before. 

Here are some references if you get stuck and you want to figure it out yourself:

Feel free to create your own text files and play with the repository. In fact I encourage that you do create a text file and
try to add it to the repository. It's pretty much the same as changing a file.
