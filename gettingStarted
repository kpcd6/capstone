Steps to install github tools

1) Go to: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git
2) Install the Github native app if you want and install the latest version 
of Git. If you're doing everything over babbage, git should already be installed.
3) Follow the Instructions on the Set up Git webpage


Steps to fork the github repository ( in other words, make a copy of it on your machine that you can change and edit without compromising the main working version of the project) 

1) Go to: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo and follow the directions (note:it's a little harder on windows but there are instructions)
2) instead of Spoon-Knife.git the git repository is called capstone so use 'git clone https://github.com/harrison-n/capstone.git' (might be slightly different in windows)
3) make sure you do the Configure Remotes step 

Make changes to the project and commit them to the repository
1) So now you should have the most updated version of the project and have these files in the folder capstone - "README.md, gettingStarted, names.txt"
2) We are going to add our name to the names.txt file and update the repository. 
3) open up names.txt in your clone of the repository 
4) add [Your name] has completed this exercise
5) save your changes and exit names.txt
6) make a commit and update the repository by running
	git commit -m '[add description of your update here]' 
	and then
	git push origin master 
7) Finished. I will have to check and confirm your changes before it appears on the github website in the repository.
