Steps to install github tools

1) Go to: https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git
2) Install the Github native app if you want and install the latest version 
of Git. If you're doing everything over babbage, git should already be installed.
3) Follow the Instructions on the Set up Git webpage


Steps to fork the github repository ( in other words, make a copy of it on your machine that you can change and edit without compromising the main working version of the project) 

1) Go to: https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo and follow the directions
2) instead of Spoon-Knife.git the git repository is called capstone so use 'git clone https://github.com/harrison-n/capstone.git' (might be slightly different in windows)
3) make sure you do the Configure Remotes step
